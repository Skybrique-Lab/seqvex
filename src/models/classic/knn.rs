//! K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) prediction: read-only inference over stored
//! reference observations and targets.
//!
//! This is the third classic-ML slice and the fifth algorithm of the current
//! set. It exists to probe observation-backed model state, distance computation,
//! and nearest-neighbor search, not to justify new storage infrastructure.
//!
//! # Mathematical contract
//!
//! With `N` stored references `(r_i, y_i)`, `r_i ∈ R^d`, `y_i ∈ R`, query `x`,
//! and `k` neighbors, the reference uses **squared Euclidean** distance
//!
//! ```text
//! D(x, r_i) = Σ_j (x_j − r_ij)^2
//! ```
//!
//! Neighbors are the first `k` references under the total order
//! `(D(x, r_i), i)` ascending; prediction is the **unweighted mean** of their
//! targets in that order. `sqrt` is strictly increasing on `[0, ∞)`, so ordering
//! by `D` equals ordering by Euclidean distance; squared distance is used because
//! only neighbor *rank* matters for an unweighted mean. A future distance-
//! weighted rule would have to weight by `sqrt(D)`, since `D` and `sqrt(D)` are
//! not interchangeable as magnitudes. Classification, metric configuration, and
//! weighting are deliberately out of scope.
//!
//! # Ownership
//!
//! [`Knn`] owns its immutable `Vec<Reference>` (features and targets),
//! `dimension`, and `k` after construction. Inference takes `&self`, never
//! mutates the model, and needs no reusable scratch or workspace: the `O(N)`
//! candidate buffer is a transient local allocation inside [`Knn::predict`].
//! This is the ownership hypothesis's "immutable parameters shared, scratch
//! local" case, not the GRU's model-owned-workspace topology.
//!
//! # State semantics
//!
//! A query depends only on itself and the immutable references, so prediction is
//! independent across queries and `State` is the **most recent prediction**,
//! matching [`LinearRegression`](super::linear_regression::LinearRegression) and
//! [`DecisionTree`](super::decision_tree::DecisionTree). No temporal state is
//! introduced merely because Seqvex is streaming-first.
//!
//! # Micro-batch
//!
//! Because queries are independent, [`Knn::predict_batch`] is a model-local,
//! order-preserving capability over a caller-bounded slice, not a generic
//! micro-batch executor. The first element failure fails the whole call
//! [`KnnError`] with no partial output, matching the other classic slices.
//!
//! # Numerics
//!
//! The `f32` substrate ([`Vector`]) is reused; no `f64` distance accumulation is
//! introduced. Finite references are required at construction
//! ([`KnnError::NonFiniteReference`]); a query is validated for dimension then
//! finiteness ([`KnnError::NonFiniteInput`]); the output is not validated, in
//! line with the other prediction-only slices. Squared distances are non-negative
//! and can overflow to `+inf` for large finite inputs (multiple `+inf` distances
//! then tie and are ordered by reference index); distances can underflow to
//! `0.0` for very small values, which likewise tie deterministically. These are
//! expected IEEE-754 `f32` behaviours, and the caller is responsible for keeping
//! magnitudes representable.
//!
//! [`LinearRegression`]: super::linear_regression::LinearRegression
//! [`DecisionTree`]: super::decision_tree::DecisionTree
